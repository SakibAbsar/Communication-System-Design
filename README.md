# Communication-System-Design
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of an OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) point-to-point communication system for RF signal transmission analysis. The project simulates a complete communication chain, including transmitter, channel, and receiver components, optimized for performance and error rate reduction under various channel conditions.

Project Overview
The project simulates an OFDM-based RF communication system designed to:

Analyze BER (Bit Error Rate) vs. SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) performance under AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) conditions.
Enhance signal quality through optimized modulation (4-, 16-, 64-QAM) and channel coding.
Improve RF power efficiency and minimize out-of-band radiation.
Features
OFDM Modulation and Demodulation: Supports 4-, 16-, and 64-QAM modulation schemes for flexible transmission setups.
BER vs. SNR Analysis: Simulates and visualizes BER over various SNR levels, optimizing system performance.
RF Power Optimization: Includes digital signal processing to reduce power consumption and enhance energy efficiency.
Non-Linear Hardware Simulation: Simulates RF frontend component behavior under different SNR and hardware conditions to test signal integrity.
Key Components
Transmitter: Implements data encoding, modulation, and pilot insertion.
Channel Model: Simulates both AWGN and frequency-selective block fading.
Receiver: Performs equalization, demodulation, and error correction.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
MATLAB R2021a or later
Installation
